# React Jokes App

A small simple react project created using class components .A good practice to start with React.
This project basically fetches 10 new Jokes at a time from [Dads Joke Api](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and save it to my local storage and also we can vote the joke
by clicking on arrowup and arrow down I have added the emoji to dynamically showing the vote reaction.
